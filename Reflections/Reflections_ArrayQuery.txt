1)Lookup Table Technique
  -Space Complexity is O(n^2).
  -Time Complexity for table processing is O(n^2).
  -Query time is O(1).
  -Useful when there are more number of queries.

2)Square Root Decomposition
  -Space Complexity is O(n).
  -Time Complexity for processing is O(n).
  -Query Time is O(sqrt(n)).
  -Useful when query includes the entire range of blocks.

3)Segment Tree
  -Space Complexity is O(4n).
  -Time Complexity for query is O(logn).
  -Time Complexity for processing(building tree) is O(n).
  -Suitable when the array is static as applying update is inefficient.
