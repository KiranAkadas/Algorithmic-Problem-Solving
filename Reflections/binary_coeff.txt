There are 3 methods to get the binary coefficients for the given expression, all having the same time complexity of O(n*k)
- The recursive method can be used when only a single query is received. The method uses a stack memory of (2^n-1)*16 which is the space allocated in stack for each recursion although it is not held up permanently.
- The 2D Dynamic solution is best used when multiple queries are to be made based on the binomial coefficients. Space Complexity is O(n*k).
- The 1D Dynamic solution provides the best alternative when a single row(coefficient) needs to be fetched. Space Complexity-O(k). This Method computes iteratively each row of the pascals triangle by using the previous row and overwriting it. Thus, it squeezes the solution of a 2d solution into a single array.
